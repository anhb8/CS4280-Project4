Alina Nguyen - Project 4 - CS4280 - Storage = Local
Language: C
Purpose: The program is to parse the input, generate a parse tree, perform static semantics, and then generate a target file. 
-Target file:
1.kb.asm if keyboard input
2.file.asm if file was the input. The base name matches that of the input file, that is if input basename is t2 then output should be t2.asm.
-The parse tree is equivalent to the program in left-to-right traversal (skipping syntactic tokens if not stored in the tree).

To start the program, enter: make 
Enter any of these following commands: 
./compfs fileName or ./compfs < fileName or ./compfs
1. ./compfs fileName : Read from fileName (fileName.asm)
2. ./compfs < fileName : Read from fileName (kb.asm)
3. ./compfs : Read from keyboard input (kb.asm)
(1. Enter the string - 2. Press "Enter" - 3. Press Ctrl+D:Exit the current shell)

Remove all the object files that had been created after running program: Enter: make clean
